Algorithms to Identify Clothing Items using Fashion MNISTAlgorithms to Identify Clothing Items using Fashion MNIST DatasetsDatasets

This project is about using algorithms and detecting the identification of clothing items. Different images have
been there in the dataset and the aim of this task is to classifing images with the fashion MNIST dataset. The
datasets have been taken from the Zalando research. It has about 60000 images of training images while about
10000 is the testing images. All the images are in grayscale that are associated with the 10 classes labels. It has
same size and structure images.

The tools used for this whole analysis is Python (Jupyter notebook) and the machine learning models used in this classification is Neural Network.
